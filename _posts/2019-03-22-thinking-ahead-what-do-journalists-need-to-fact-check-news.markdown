Knowing what journalists expect in their fight against misinformation and building a tool that meet their needs is key to the development part of the Fandango Project. To this end, the Fandango team has already **collected and analysed the end user requirements needed to shape the service**. 

For this purpose, the team of Fandango has researched a few features like the **usersâ€™ context** (i.e. how a newsroom works, the importance of misinformation), **the scope of the problem** (i.e. what is misinformation, why is it difficult to detect or disprove) and the **available tools** (i.e. which other tools exist or are under development). They have also conducted a **series of interviews with journalists from the three user partners of Fandango** (Civio, ANSA and VRT) to understand their needs when it comes to misinformation and fact checking in a newsroom. The user requirements document **details realistic scenarios where Fandango could help journalists assess the veracity of a diversity of content pieces**. 

Keeping in mind not only the needs of the journalists and their context but also the tools that are already in the market, the **Fandango Project will address the emergence of misinformation by providing an online service**.
