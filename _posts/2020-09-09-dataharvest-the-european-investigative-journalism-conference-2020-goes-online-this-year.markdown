[Dataharvest](https://dataharvest.eu/) – the European Investigative Journalism Conference 2020 – goes online this year. Because of the coronavirus, organizers ([ARENA for Journalism in Europe](http://www.journalismarena.eu/)) have changed the annual conference to a three-month programme of training, discussions and workshops.

More than 120 sessions spread over 13 weeks from September to November 2020, where Europe’s top data and investigative journalists and trainers meet.
