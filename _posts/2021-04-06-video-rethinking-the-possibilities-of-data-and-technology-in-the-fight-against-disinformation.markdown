The consortium hosted on March 26th its final event with a series of online discussions under the title **“Rethinking the possibilities of data and technology in the fight against disinformation”**.

The goal of the event was to check the initial hypothesis of Fandango (that it is possible to leverage Big Data and Artificial Intelligence techniques to address this aggressive emergence of unverified news content, manipulated content and disinformation) against current state of the art in the news verification landscape and to have a deep and focused discussion about the European the adoption of innovative technologies in the media ecosystem and, specifically, in the fight against disinformation.

The discussions touched political and institutional, technological and research and industrial dimensions, with a strong involvement of other running projects such as the European Digital Media Observatory, the AI4Media project, Media Futures or the Social Observatory for Disinformation and Social Media Analysis. 

148 professionals registered in the event, and 109 (74%) from 20 different countries positively attended and participated in the event.

We are very grateful to the communication unit of DG CONNECT, the European Digital Media Observatory, SOMA, MediaFutures and ANSA for their cooperation to disseminate this activity.

Thank you to all speakers and the audience that made possible this fruitful discussion.
