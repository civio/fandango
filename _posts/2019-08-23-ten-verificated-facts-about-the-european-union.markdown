With both the European Commission and the Parliament already established, European elections feels long gone, as well as the fact-checking efforts to tackle misinformation during the campaigns. However, many of the misinformation spread covered core information about the functioning of the European Union and are not entirely tied to elections matters. We have collected some of these misinformation pieces fact-checked by several platforms and even the European Commission itself. We hope we don't have to keep fact checking the same misleading information but, in case we need to, below you will find ten facts already verified to keep in mind:
