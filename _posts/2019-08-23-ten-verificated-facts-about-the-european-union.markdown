With both the European Commission and Parliament already established, european elections feels long gone. Along with it, the factchecking efforts to tackle misinformation during the campaing. However, many of the misinformation spread covered core information about the functioning of the European Union and are not entering tied to elections matters. We have collected some of these misinformation pieces factchecked by several platforms and even the European Commission itself. We hope we don't have to keep fact checking the same misleading information but, in case we need to, here it is ten facts already verificated to keep in mind:
