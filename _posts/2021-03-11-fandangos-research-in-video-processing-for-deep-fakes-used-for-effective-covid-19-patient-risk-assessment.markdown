In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, Fandango consortium members allocate technologies and data to support research that will provide insights during these challenging times.

CERTH (The Centre for Research and Technology - Hellas) has contributed to and published [a new paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/6/2842/htm) that uses concepts and knowledge from Fandango's research in video processing for deep-fakes for effective and efficient Computed Tomography (CT)-based risk assessment to improve treatment patient care. This article introduces a data-driven approach built on top of volume-of-interest aware deep neural networks for automatic COVID-19 patient risk assessment (discharged, hospitalized, intensive care unit) based on lung infection quantization through segmentation and, subsequently, CT classification.

This article belongs to the [Special Issue Deep Learning: AI Steps Up in Battle against COVID-19](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph/special_issues/AI_against_COVID-19). It has been partially funded by Fandango and private funds of the Humanitas Research Hospital.
