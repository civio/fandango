 > During the last decades, the volume of multimedia content posted in social networks has grown exponentially and such information is immediately propagated and consumed by a significant number of users. In this scenario, the disruption of fake news providers and bot accounts for spreading propaganda information as well as sensitive content throughout the network has fostered applied research to automatically measure the reliability of social networks accounts via Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we present a multilingual approach for addressing the bot identification task in Twitter via Deep learning (DL) approaches to support end-users when checking the credibility of a certain Twitter account. To do so, several experiments were conducted using state-of-the-art Multilingual Language Models to generate an encoding of the text-based features of the user account that are later on concatenated with the rest of the metadata to build a potential input vector on top of a Dense Network denoted as Bot-DenseNet. Consequently, this paper assesses the language constraint from previous studies where the encoding of the user account only considered either the metadata information or the metadata information together with some basic semantic text features. Moreover, the Bot-DenseNet produces a low-dimensional representation of the user account which can be used for any application within the Information Retrieval (IR) framework.
