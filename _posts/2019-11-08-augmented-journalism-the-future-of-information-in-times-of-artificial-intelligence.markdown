“The conflict between true and false is an eternal question that no machine or algorithm can solve definitively but, if used as a contribution combined with people's professionalism, it can have a decisive impact", stated Francesco Saverio Nucci, Engineering's Director of Application Research and coordinator of Fandango. The scope of these declarations was the event "Augmented journalism: the future of information in times of Artificial Intelligence" organized by the Italian news agency ANSA, also  a member of the Fandango consortium.

Panels were set to be the perfect scenario to debate and analyze the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in newsrooms and the future to come with it. ¿The conclusion? Even if one day the journalist is replace by IA, that day is still far away. Fandango, however, aims to help with the transition. The project, which started last year and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, has the final objective of developing an IT system which, thanks to the use of the most advanced Big Data applications, Artificial Intelligence, image recognition and text analysis, can help fight fake news, promoting truthful information and the consequent benefits at economic, social and cultural level.

"The Artificial Intelligence that animates Fandango aims to act as a strong ally of the press in the fight against fake news for information that is transparent, truthful and built on the basis of data”, explained Nucci. To complete the debate, there was the experience of the Spanish Agencia EFE with "Narrativa", a software that writes news pieces based on data analysis similar to the ones written by journalists.
