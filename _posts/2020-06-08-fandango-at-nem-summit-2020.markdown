Project partner Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) presented an article at the NEM Summit 2020, an annual event driving the future of digital experience of the EU content, media & creative industries. The paper, "[A Multi-Modal approach for FAke News discovery and propagation from big Data ANalysis and artificial inteliGence Operations](https://nem-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-5-a_multimodal_approach_for_fake_news_discovery_and_propagation.pdf)", looks into Fandango's multi-modal solution for analysing large volumes of media content in order to detect potential fake news providers.

The article describes how Fandango involves data ingestion, processing and analysis to extract relevant features and serve as a means of verification of multimedia contents. The modular ecosystem treats the information from a modality perspective (i.e. text, images, videos, meta-data) and offers both single and global evaluation of the content’s fakeness probability.
