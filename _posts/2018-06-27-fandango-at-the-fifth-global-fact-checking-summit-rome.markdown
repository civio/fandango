The Global Fact-Checking Summit ([Global Fact](https://gfworkshops.org)) is the premier conference dedicated to fact-checking worldwide. Global Fact is organized by Poynter's [International Fact-Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/channels/fact-checking) and has been held every year since 2014. Fact-checkers from all continents meet to share experiences about evaluating public discourse and getting closer to the truth. 

David Cabo from Civio, Fandango consortium member, attended to the event to know first hand the most active fact-checking organisations' needs, the tools they use and the ones they are trying to build. For example, [ClaimReview](https://schema.org/ClaimReview), a data format defined by Schema.org and supported by Google, which uses it to detect fact-checks when crawling the net, and then promotes and highlights them in search results. Or Full Fact's [Trends](https://fullfact.org/automated), a custom search engine to check how a particular quote or claim spreads across online news, parliament transcripts and selected social media accounts.
