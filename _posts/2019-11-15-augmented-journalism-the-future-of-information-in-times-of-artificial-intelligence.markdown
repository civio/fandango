“The conflict between true and false is an eternal question that no machine or algorithm can solve definitively but, if used as a contribution combined with people's professionalism, it can have a decisive impact", says Francesco Saverio Nucci, Engineering's Director of Application Research and coordinator of Fandango. He spoke at  the event "Augmented Journalism: the Future of Information in Times of Artificial Intelligence" organized by the Italian news agency ANSA, also a member of the Fandango consortium.

Panels were organized to debate and analyze the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in newsrooms and the future to come with it. The conclusion? Even if one day the journalist is replaced by IA, that day is still far away. Fandango, however, aims to help with the transition. The project, which started last year and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, has the final objective of developing an IT system which, thanks to the use of the most advanced Big Data applications, AI, image recognition and text analysis, can help fight misinformation, promoting truthful information and the consequent benefits at economic, social and cultural level.

Nucci also explained that AI employed by Fandango could "act as a strong ally of the press in the fight against fake news for information that is transparent, truthful and built on the basis of data”. Spanish Agencia EFE shared their experiences with "Narrativa", a software that writes news pieces based on data analysis similar to the ones written by journalists.

A group of experts from the London School of Economics also presented a report illustrating current uses of AI in newsrooms based on a survey of more than 70 newsrooms. Trends point in the direction of using AI in gathering news pieces and large amounts of information, in distribution and publication for knowing better their readers and for the writing. It seems like the future is not that far away.
