Ital-IA was the [first national conference in Italy about Artificial Intelligence](http://www.ital-ia.it) and took place in Rome during 18th and 19th March. Fangango was one of the **projects selected for showcasing under the title *AI for media and entertainment***. 

Massimo Magaldi, from [Engineering Ingegneria Informatica](https://www.eng.it/en/), was in charge of doing a brief introduction of the Fandango Project and how it would use IA to tackle misinformation. In the presentation, Massimo explained how **Fandango uses several IA modules to analyze and evaluate different parts of an online article** (text, images/videos, author, source, metadata, etc.). This resultes in a group of **indicators that show the probability of false, misleading or manipulated information**.
