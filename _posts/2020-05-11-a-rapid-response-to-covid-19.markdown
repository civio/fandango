In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, Fandango consortium members are allocating tecnologies and data to support research that will provide insights during these challenging times. 

Fandango project through consortium partner CERTH (Centre for Research and Technology - Hellas) will contribute to the [Security Research Rapid Response to COVID19](https://sec3r.com/), an umbrella platform bringing together the capabilities of the security research community to support the global efforts to combat COVID19.

The Sec3R platform aims to provide knowledge and resources for public authorities, blue light services and researchers worldwide in their response to the pandemic.

Through CERTH's participation, technologies that are developed within Fandango will be also used in support of the global efforts in to combat COVID-19.

CERTH is also preparing models and components to contribute to [www.covid19challenge.eu](https://www.covid19challenge.eu/), a platform for open research on large Covid-19 imaging datasets.
