Summer has been hot and sofocating for some of Fandango's partners, specially the ones in Italy, Greece and Spain. However, we haven't stopped on learning and applying new trends to our work. Here, we present our lastest discoveries and insights.

### Nem Summit

Fandango got to be presented at the Nem Summit on late May in Croatia under the session *Trusting media: joint reflections from media industry*. This panel aimed to hold a high-level discussion on impact of disinformation and effective strategies for tackling it. 

Massimo Magaldi, from Engineering, was in charge of Fandango's presentation and talked about the advanced analytics services developed by the project to fight misinformation. To do so, Fandango has a news disinformation detection and scoring, based on Big Data analysis techniques (ML models and Graph Analysis), and performs data investigation, through an interactive exploration of news, open data and verified claims databases.

If you wish to have detailed information about the processes behind these features, please access to the full presentation in this [link](https://nem-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/magaldi_fandango.pdf).

### Global Fact 6

We also attended the *Global Fact 6* event in Cape Town, South Africa in mid June. In there, we learned about the lastest trends in the fact-checking network and got the chance to talk with proffessionals both from the media and technological sector.

P.S. It is almost ten hours of video, but we promise you that listen to the conferences is worth the effort.
