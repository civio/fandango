The Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie is the public broadcaster of the Flemish Community in Belgium. Its mission is to reach the largest possible number of viewers and listeners with a diversity of programs that arouse and fulfill their interest. To accomplish this, VRT owns 3 TV channels (EeÃÅn, Ketnet, Canvas), 5 radio stations (Radio1, Radio2, Klara, Studio Brussel and MNM) and 2 web portals (deredactie.be and sporza.be) focussing on news and sports. Furthermore, VRT has a full range of digital products, including an over the top video platform (vrtnu.be) and a set of digital radio apps.

VRT will take the following project management roles in FANDANGO:
- Part of the general project management team, and involved in project coordination tasks
- Leading WP6 on Big Data Value validation through piloting.

In the pilot activities, VRT will mainly be involved in the pilot activities around fake news in climate change. In this direction VRT will also play minor roles in data provision and validation of pilots in the other application areas. For this purpose, VRT will contribute audiovisual content and associated metadata (news articles, subtitles, tags, technical metadata).
