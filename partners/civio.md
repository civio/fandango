### Civio

FundacioÃÅn Ciudadana Civio is a non-for-profit organization, specialized in data and investigative journalism and access to information. Civio's main objective is to facilitate the access and interpretation of public information, as well as increasing citizens' participation in public debate using a combination of technology and journalism, and always through the use of primary sources. Civio addresses fields such as public procurement, budgets and expenditure, governmental pardons, public-private power networks and conflicts of interests. Our targeted advocacy agenda allows us to raise these issues with decision-makers, completing the cycle for meaningful change.
